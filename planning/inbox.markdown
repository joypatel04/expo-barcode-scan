* As a cahshier,I need a way to enter teh price of product by hand, so that i can sell a product to a customer even when the point of sale terminal doesn't find a price for that product

* As a store manager, I want to be reminded that a product's price was not found, so that I can fix the price list to avoid this happening again.
